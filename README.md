# AI-Video-Generator
Creating a video from text involves multiple steps, such as text-to-speech conversion, generating visuals, and combining them into a video. Below is an example of how you can do it using inbuilt libraries like gTTS for text-to-speech, OpenCV to generate video frames, and moviepy to combine the audio and video. For third-party services, I'll demonstrate integrating the TwelveLabs API, assuming they provide such a service for creating videos.
1. Install Required Libraries

First, make sure to install the required libraries:

pip install gtts opencv-python moviepy requests

2. Code to Generate Video from Text
a) Basic Python Script Using Inbuilt Libraries

import cv2
import numpy as np
import os
from gtts import gTTS
from moviepy.editor import AudioFileClip, ImageSequenceClip

# Text-to-speech: Convert Text to Speech (Audio)
def generate_audio(text, filename="output.mp3"):
    tts = gTTS(text)
    tts.save(filename)

# Create Video from Text (Simple visual using OpenCV)
def create_video_from_text(text, audio_filename="output.mp3", video_filename="output_video.mp4"):
    # Create audio file from text
    generate_audio(text, audio_filename)
    
    # Load audio file
    audio_clip = AudioFileClip(audio_filename)
    duration = audio_clip.duration  # Duration of the video should match audio duration
    
    # Create a simple video (here we use a black background with the text appearing)
    frames = []
    frame_rate = 30
    width, height = 640, 480
    
    # Create a video frame with text displayed
    for i in range(int(duration * frame_rate)):
        img = np.zeros((height, width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)  # Black background
        font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX
        cv2.putText(img, text, (50, height // 2), font, 1, (255, 255, 255), 2, cv2.LINE_AA)
        frames.append(img)
    
    # Convert frames to video
    video_clip = ImageSequenceClip(frames, fps=frame_rate)
    video_clip = video_clip.set_audio(audio_clip)
    
    # Write video to file
    video_clip.write_videofile(video_filename, codec="libx264")

# Example usage:
text = "Hello, welcome to this video generation demo!"
create_video_from_text(text)

In this script:

    generate_audio converts the provided text to an audio file using Googleâ€™s TTS (gTTS).
    create_video_from_text generates a video using OpenCV by displaying the text on each frame and using moviepy to combine the audio and video.

b) Using TwelveLabs API (for generating video via third-party service)

Assuming that TwelveLabs provides an API to generate videos (which may be an AI-driven video generation service), you would need to interact with their API as shown below.

import requests
import json

# Function to interact with TwelveLabs API (Assuming API URL and key are provided)
def generate_video_from_text_with_twelvelabs(text, api_url, api_key):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    payload = {
        "text": text,  # Text for generating the video
        "other_params": {}  # Optional additional parameters (e.g., length, style, etc.)
    }
    
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))

    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Assuming the response contains the video file or a link to download
        video_url = response.json().get('video_url')
        print(f"Video generated successfully: {video_url}")
    else:
        print(f"Error generating video: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")

# Example usage with TwelveLabs (replace API URL and API key)
text = "This is an example of video generated from text using TwelveLabs API."
api_url = "https://api.twelvelabs.com/v1/generate_video"  # Placeholder URL
api_key = "your_twelvelabs_api_key"
generate_video_from_text_with_twelvelabs(text, api_url, api_key)

In this example:

    You send a POST request to the TwelveLabs API with the text to be converted into video.
    You would need to replace api_url and api_key with the actual values from TwelveLabs.
    The response might contain a link to download or view the generated video.

Considerations:

    Audio-Visual Sync: In the basic example, you create a video with static frames. For a more sophisticated approach, you could integrate video elements like animations, transitions, or dynamic visuals.
    API Costs/Limitations: Be mindful of rate limits, costs, and API restrictions from third-party services like TwelveLabs.
    Video Styling: You can modify the create_video_from_text function to use more advanced styling (e.g., backgrounds, fonts, animations) to improve the video output.

This approach gives you a flexible method to create text-to-video conversions either entirely with Python or by utilizing third-party APIs for advanced video generation.
